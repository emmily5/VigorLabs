              Chronic inflammation has been linked to fatigue, brain fog, joint
              aches, digestive distress, and increased long-term disease risk.
              The good news: your plate can become a daily reset button. Making
              thoughtful choices in your meals and snacks can dramatically calm
              inflammation and support your well-being.

            <h2>Start with a Color Map</h2>
            <p>
              Fill half your plate with vegetables or fruit. Rotate through
              berries, leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli,
              kale, and cabbage), and orange produce rich in beta-carotene, such
              as carrots and sweet potatoes. The more diverse your produce, the
              broader the spectrum of micronutrients and natural antioxidants.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Blue/Purple:</b> Berries, red grapes, eggplant—rich in
                anthocyanins with potent anti-inflammatory properties.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Green:</b> Spinach, kale, broccoli—loaded with chlorophyll
                and fiber, supporting both cell health and gut balance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Orange/Yellow:</b> Carrots, sweet potatoes, squash—packed
                with beta-carotene and vitamin C.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Red:</b> Tomatoes, beets, peppers—source of lycopene and
                betalains, both linked to reduced inflammation.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Build the Remaining Half with Balance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Choose lean protein such as salmon (high in omega-3s), legumes,
                tofu, or pasture-raised eggs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add smart carbs like quinoa, farro, wild rice, or sweet potato
                for slow-burning energy and fiber.
              </li>
              <li>
                Include healthy fats: extra virgin olive oil, avocado, a handful
                of nuts (walnuts, almonds), or seeds (chia, flaxseed, pumpkin).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Together, these foods provide not just calories, but the raw
              materials your body uses to regulate swelling, immunity, and
              healing.
            </p>

            <h2>Label Reading Made Easy</h2>
            <p>
              Look for short ingredient lists and avoid added sugars ending in
              “-ose” (like glucose, sucrose, fructose). Minimize refined oils
              (such as soybean, corn, and palm) that can tip the omega balance
              toward inflammation. Choose foods high in fiber (at least 3g per
              serving) and low in artificial additives.
            </p>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>Pantry Upgrade Checklist</h3>
              <p>
                Swap white rice for brown or wild rice; keep turmeric and ginger
                handy for an anti-inflammatory spice boost; stock a shelf of
                canned beans for fast and easy fiber; choose natural nut butters
                without palm oil or added sugar; and try unsweetened teas like
                green tea, which provides the anti-inflammatory power of
                polyphenols.
              </p>
            </div>
            <blockquote>
              “Think in terms of abundance rather than restriction—add more
              protective plants before you worry about perfection,” reminds
              nutrition coach Maya Kim.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Everyday Practices for Less Inflammation</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hydrate:</b> Sip water or herbal teas throughout the
                day—dehydration raises inflammatory markers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Spice it up:</b> Add turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and garlic
                to soups, stews, and salads. In studies, these spices combat
                inflammation at the cellular level.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Mind your snacks:</b> Swap conventional snacks (chips,
                cookies) for apple slices with almond butter, hummus with carrot
                sticks, or yogurt with berries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cook simply:</b> Grill, steam, or roast vegetables instead of
                deep-frying, preserving their anti-inflammatory compounds.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Limit processed meats:</b> Reduce bacon, sausage, and deli
                meats; replace with canned wild salmon or cooked lentils.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Anti-Inflammatory Meal Idea</h2>
            <p>
              For a flavorful, anti-inflammatory dinner, try this quick bowl:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>1 cup steamed quinoa or brown rice as a base</li>
              <li>1 serving grilled salmon or marinated tofu</li>
              <li>
                Mixed greens (spinach, arugula) and roasted sweet potatoes
              </li>
              <li>
                Sliced avocado, a drizzle of olive oil, sprinkled with pumpkin
                seeds and pomegranate
              </li>
              <li>
                Top with a warm ginger-turmeric dressing for an extra
                anti-inflammatory punch
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to See a Professional</h2>
            <p>
              An anti-inflammatory diet is a foundational step, but persistent
              or severe symptoms—like joint pain, swelling, or ongoing
              fatigue—deserve the guidance of a healthcare provider or
              registered dietitian. A professional can help rule out food
              sensitivities or underlying health conditions that may need more
              targeted therapy.
