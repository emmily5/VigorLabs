              When tension spikes, fast relief matters. These practical tools
              calm the mind and body without disrupting your day. Use them at
              your desk, in the car, or wherever stress sneaks up—so you can
              reset and keep moving forward.

            <h2>90-Second Breathing Reset</h2>
            <p>
              Inhale through your nose for four counts, hold for two, and exhale
              for six. Repeat five rounds. The extended exhale signals safety to
              your brain and slows your heart rate. For more grounding, rest
              your hand on your chest or abdomen as you breathe.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Try “square breathing”: inhale, hold, exhale, and pause for four
                counts each.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you’re overwhelmed, exhale with a soft sigh or “haaa”
                sound—it stimulates the vagus nerve for faster calm.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Journal Your Top Three Wins</h2>
            <p>
              A quick gratitude prompt counteracts negativity bias. Write down
              three wins from the last 24 hours—small victories count. Try a
              digital note, sticky pad, or voice memo if time is tight.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Celebrate effort, not only outcomes (“I made my bed,” “I sent
                that tough email”).
              </li>
              <li>
                Repeat this after any big stressor to shift your focus to
                progress.
              </li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Stress Reset Checklist</h3>
              <p>
                Pair breathwork with a glass of water, step outdoors for fresh
                air, and mute notifications for five minutes to finish the reset
                strong. If you’re working late, wash your face or splash cold
                water to help reboot your mind.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Move with Intention</h3>
            <p>
              Stretch your neck and shoulders, then perform 10 slow air squats
              or wall push-ups. Light movement releases muscle tension that
              keeps cortisol elevated. In a chair? Roll your shoulders and twist
              side to side, or stand and reach tall overhead.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Try a “body scan”: tense and release each muscle group from head
                to toe, noticing where you hold stress.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pace around the room or swing your arms—rhythmic movement helps
                reset the nervous system.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Adapt on the Go: Mini Resets Anywhere</h2>
            <p>
              Short on privacy? Pop in headphones for calming music or a short
              guided meditation. Stuck in traffic or transit? Breathe deeply,
              unclench your jaw, and give your gaze a break by looking at
              something in the distance. Micro-pauses matter even in busy
              moments.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “Short recovery breaks protect long-term productivity,” says
              therapist Julian Costa. “You’ll accomplish more once your nervous
              system is steady.”
            </blockquote>
            <h2>Keep the Calm Going</h2>
            <p>
              Consistency counts. Stack these micro-resets throughout your day
              (before meetings, between chores, after tough calls) for real
              resilience. The more you practice, the easier it gets to switch
              gears from stress to steady calm—no matter what comes your way.
