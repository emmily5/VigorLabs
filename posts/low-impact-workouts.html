              You don’t need explosive jumps or heavy barbells to feel stronger.
              These low-impact routines protect joints while keeping your heart
              rate in the “just right” zone. Whether you’re a beginner, working
              through an injury, or want to train smart for longevity, these
              workouts deliver real results.

            <h2>Dynamic Warm-Up</h2>
            <p>
              Begin with 5–7 minutes of gentle movement to boost mobility and
              reduce injury risk. Try ankle circles, cat-cow stretches, and
              thoracic rotations. Add arm circles and hip openers if you’re
              stiff from sitting. These moves lubricate joints and wake up
              stabilizer muscles that keep your form sharp.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>10 ankle circles per foot</li>
              <li>8–10 cat-cow stretches</li>
              <li>8 thoracic rotations per side</li>
              <li>10 arm circles (forward and back)</li>
              <li>
                10 hip openers (standing knee circles or figure four stretch)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Band and Bodyweight Circuit</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>15 banded squats</li>
              <li>12 incline push-ups on a countertop or bench</li>
              <li>20 marching glute bridges</li>
              <li>10 resistance band rows</li>
              <li>30 seconds of shadow boxing with light resistance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Repeat the circuit three times with one-minute breaks. Focus on
              controlled tempo over speed. Form comes first — keep movement
              smooth and avoid “locking” joints at the top or bottom of each
              rep.
            </p>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>Trainer Tip</h3>
              <p>
                Use a 1-2-3 tempo: one second to lower, two seconds to pause,
                and three seconds to drive up. You’ll feel the burn without
                pounding the joints. If you need less impact, try wall sits,
                alternating step-ups, or seated resistance band exercises.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Cardio Options That Go Easy on Knees</h3>
            <p>
              Low-impact cardio doesn’t mean low results. Mix brisk incline
              walks, indoor cycling, swimming laps, or rowing. Dance fitness,
              elliptical training, and step aerobics (with a low riser) are also
              joint-friendly. Try this interval structure: 4-minute intervals at
              moderate intensity followed by 2 minutes of easy recovery. Repeat
              3–4 times.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Walking:</strong> Add speed bursts or hills to raise
                your heart rate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Swimming:</strong> Vary your strokes for all-around
                strength.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Indoor cycling:</strong> Use light-to-moderate
                resistance and steady cadence for 20–30 minutes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Add Variety for Motivation</h2>
            <p>
              Switch routines every few weeks or alternate workout types
              throughout the week to prevent boredom. Pair strength and mobility
              days with cardio days, or mix formats (Pilates, yoga flow,
              functional training) for a balanced, sustainable routine.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Pilates:</strong> Builds deep core strength and spinal
                stability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Yoga flows:</strong> Emphasize active stretching and
                mindful movement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Water aerobics:</strong> Great for all ages, especially
                if managing arthritis or recovering from injury.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Functional exercises:</strong> Step-ups, farmer’s walks,
                and woodchops train muscles used in daily life.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Why Low-Impact Works — at Every Age</h2>
            <p>
              Regular low-impact exercise improves circulation, flexibility,
              balance, and muscle tone — all without excess wear and tear. These
              workouts are especially valuable if you have joint pain, are
              healing from injury, are pregnant, or want to supplement a
              higher-intensity program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember: results come from “just right” effort you can repeat
              consistently.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “Consistency beats intensity. Thirty minutes of low-impact work
              five times per week improves endurance and mobility,” says coach
              Renee Harper.
