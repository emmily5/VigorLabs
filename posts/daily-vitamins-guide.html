            <h2>Core Vitamins That Cover the Basics</h2>
            <p>
              For most healthy adults, a balanced multivitamin fills in
              occasional nutritional gaps. Vitamin D3 is crucial for bone,
              immune, and mood support—especially if you live in northern
              climates or spend little time in the sun. Magnesium glycinate is
              gentle on the gut, supports sleep, and helps manage stress.
              Omega-3s (from fish oil or algae) benefit both heart and brain
              function, and are often lacking in Western diets.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Teenagers & Young Adults:</strong> Focus on calcium and
                vitamin D during growth spurts; consider an iron supplement if
                your doctor recommends it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Adults 40+:</strong> B vitamins (especially B12),
                vitamin D3, and magnesium become more important as absorption
                and needs shift with age.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pregnant or Breastfeeding:</strong> Choose prenatal
                vitamins with methylfolate (rather than folic acid) and check
                for appropriate iron, iodine, and DHA levels.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Read Supplement Labels</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Look for third-party testing seals such as USP, NSF, or
                Informed-Choice to ensure product quality and ingredient
                accuracy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compare the “% Daily Value” to ensure you aren’t megadosing.
                Getting more than 100% of the daily value of some vitamins, like
                A or E, can be harmful.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid fillers like artificial colors, titanium dioxide, and
                hydrogenated oils. Watch for unwanted binders, sweeteners, and
                flavorings.
              </li>
              <li>
                For herbals or adaptogens, check standardized extract
                percentages for potency—look for clinical research supporting
                their use.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
              <p>
                Pair fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) with a meal that contains
                healthy fats for better absorption. For example, take vitamin D
                with breakfast containing avocado or eggs.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Common Supplement Pitfalls</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mixing interactions:</strong> Calcium can block iron
                absorption; magnesium may interfere with some antibiotics. Space
                out doses when needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Going overboard:</strong> More is not always better.
                Excessive intake can strain kidneys or liver.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>One-size-fits-all:</strong> Individual needs differ.
                Genetics, lifestyle, health conditions, and medications all
                change what’s best for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>"All Natural" ≠ Safer:</strong> Herbal supplements can
                still interact with medications or trigger side effects—verify
                with your provider.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>When to Talk to Your Doctor</h2>
            <p>
              Review your supplement list during annual checkups, especially if
              you take prescriptions. Blood work can reveal real nutrient gaps
              and prevent overlaps or risky combinations. Bring your pill
              bottles or take pictures of labels to appointments for an easy
              review.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider extra testing if you follow a restricted diet (vegan,
              gluten-free), have a chronic health condition, or have had
              bariatric surgery—these situations may benefit from customized
              supplement strategies.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “Clarity beats quantity. A targeted regimen based on lab work is a
              smarter investment than a shelf full of random pills,” says Dr.
              Elise Navarro.

              </li>
              <li>
                Omega-3 capsule with lunch or dinner (ideally with a meal
                containing fat)
              </li>
