              Testosterone shapes energy, strength, libido, and body composition.
              You do not need risky shortcuts to improve it. Use the plan below
              to protect sleep, train correctly, and feed your endocrine system
              the inputs it needs.

            <h2>Step 1: Sleep Like It Is Hormone Therapy</h2>
            <p>
              Testosterone pulses happen at night. Missing sleep can drop levels
              by 10–15% in a week. Keep a fixed wake time, use morning light to
              anchor your rhythm, and limit screens 60 minutes before bed. If
              you snore or wake unrefreshed, screen for sleep apnea—it tanks T.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2: Train With Intention</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Lift 3x weekly: focus on compound moves (squat, hinge, push,
                pull) for 6–12 reps, 3–4 sets.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add two 15–20 minute cardio intervals weekly for heart health
                and insulin sensitivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid extreme caloric deficits; chronic undereating suppresses
                hormones.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step 3: Eat to Support Endocrine Health</h2>
            <p>
              Aim for 0.7–1g of protein per pound of goal body weight. Include
              healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, eggs) to maintain cholesterol,
              the building block of testosterone. Fill your plate with colorful
              plants to lower inflammation and improve nutrient density.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Key micronutrients:</strong> Zinc, magnesium, vitamin D,
                and B vitamins support hormone production.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stable glucose:</strong> Pair carbs with protein and fat
                to avoid blood sugar spikes that blunt testosterone.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Smart Supplementation</h3>
            <p>
              Consider vitamin D3 (if deficient), magnesium glycinate at night,
              and creatine for strength. Tongkat ali and ashwagandha show
              promising data for stress and free testosterone, but buy from
              vetted brands and monitor with your clinician.
            </p>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>4-Week Progress Markers</h3>
              <p>
                Better morning energy, improved training performance, steadier
                mood, and more consistent morning erections indicate you are on
                track. Retest labs after 12 weeks to measure change.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Alcohol, Stress, and Weight</h2>
            <p>
              Limit alcohol to two nights weekly; more than that reliably drops
              testosterone and sleep quality. Chronic stress elevates cortisol,
              which competes with testosterone. Daily breathwork or a 10-minute
              walk after meals keeps cortisol and glucose in check. If you carry
              significant abdominal fat, losing 5–10% of body weight can lift
              free T substantially.
            </p>
            <h2>When to Seek Medical Support</h2>
            <p>
              If lifestyle changes do not budge symptoms after 12 weeks, talk to
              your clinician about deeper testing (free T, SHBG, LH/FSH, thyroid
              function). Avoid unsupervised hormone use; dosage, labs, and
              cardiovascular monitoring matter for safety.
