            <h2>Start with Air and Allergens</h2>
            <p>
              Replace HVAC filters, vacuum vents, and clean humidifiers or air
              purifiers. Open windows for 15 minutes to circulate fresh air
              while temperatures are mild. If you have allergy sufferers, wash
              curtains and wipe baseboards to remove hidden dust and pollen.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Check for mold or moisture in bathrooms and around windows.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clean ceiling fans and light fixtures that collect allergens.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consider adding houseplants—some (like spider plants or peace
                lilies) improve air purity naturally.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Rotate Wardrobes and Linens</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Declutter closets before storing last season’s clothing; donate
                what no longer fits or is unused.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wash blankets with a hypoallergenic detergent before packing
                away or putting fresh ones on beds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Store items in labeled, breathable bins to prevent musty odors
                and make next season’s switch easy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Swap out throw pillow covers, curtains, and rugs for lighter or
                warmer versions to update your space quickly.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Pet and Child Considerations</h3>
            <p>
              Wash pet bedding and check that their spaces are comfortable for
              changing temperatures. If you have young children, ensure their
              seasonal clothing, bedding, and outdoor gear (boots, coats, hats)
              are sized correctly and easy to access.
            </p>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>Family Safety Moment</h3>
              <p>
                Test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and review your
                emergency contact list. Keep a small kit with flashlights,
                batteries, and first aid supplies near the entryway. Store cold
                weather or storm gear where everyone can find it in a hurry.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Create Weekly Maintenance Zones</h3>
            <p>
              Assign each weekend to a specific space—kitchen, garage, bedrooms,
              outdoor areas. Short, consistent sessions simplify large chores
              and prevent overwhelm.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Kitchens: Clean refrigerator coils and pantry shelves; toss
                expired food.
              </li>
              <li>
                Garage/Sheds: Store or service seasonal tools (lawn mowers, snow
                shovels).
              </li>
              <li>
                Outdoor: Trim plants, inspect gutters, check playground or patio
                safety.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bedrooms: Flip mattresses, check for signs of pests, and dust
                underneath furniture.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Plan for Safety and Comfort with the Weather</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Spring/Summer:</strong> Check window screens, stock up
                on allergy meds, and set up fans or portable AC units.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Autumn/Winter:</strong> Inspect heating systems, seal
                drafts, restock cozy essentials (extra blankets, hot water
                bottles).
              </li>
              <li>
                Update your home emergency plan for power outages or
                storms—practice fire and exit drills with kids.
              </li>
            </ul>
