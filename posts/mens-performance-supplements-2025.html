          <div class="article-content">
            <h2>The Non-Negotiable Basics</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Creatine monohydrate:</strong> 3–5g daily. Improves
                strength, power, and possibly cognition; safe long term.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Vitamin D3:</strong> Dose based on labs; supports
                hormones, immunity, and mood.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Magnesium glycinate:</strong> 300–400mg at night for
                sleep quality and muscle relaxation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Omega-3s:</strong> 1–2g combined EPA/DHA daily to
                support heart health and inflammation control.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Blood Flow and Bedroom Performance</h2>
            <p>
              Nitric-oxide boosters can enhance vascular responsiveness and
              endurance.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>L-citrulline:</strong> 6–8g pre-workout or pre-intimacy
                to improve blood flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Beetroot powder:</strong> Natural nitrates that support
                endurance and circulation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Hormone-Friendly Adaptogens</h2>
            <p>
              Some botanicals show promise but require quality sourcing.
              Respect dosage ranges and cycle them if needed.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tongkat ali (Eurycoma):</strong> 200–400mg of
                standardized extract; may support free testosterone and libido.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ashwagandha:</strong> 300–600mg of KSM-66 or Sensoril
                extracts; can reduce stress and modestly improve T in stressed
                men.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Zinc:</strong> 15–30mg with food if your diet is low in
                zinc-rich foods (oysters, beef, pumpkin seeds).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Stack Smart, Not Heavy</h3>
            <p>
              Introduce one new supplement at a time for 2–3 weeks to gauge
              effect. Track sleep, mood, training performance, and libido to see
              whether the product earns its place.
            </p>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>Skip or Question These</h3>
              <p>
                Proprietary blends without dosing transparency, unverified SARMs
                or “herbal Viagra” pills, and mega-dose multivitamins that can
                upset digestion or interact with medications.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Quality Control Checklist</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Look for third-party testing (NSF, Informed Sport, USP).
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid sketchy Amazon-only brands; buy from reputable suppliers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Review ingredient forms—magnesium glycinate over oxide, for
                example—to ensure absorption and comfort.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Talk to Your Clinician</h2>
            <p>
              If you take medications for blood pressure, mood, or diabetes,
              review potential interactions. Supplements work best when your
              labs, sleep, and training are dialed in; they are not a replacement
              for fundamentals.
