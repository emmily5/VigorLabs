              Small, consistent morning rituals can set up your immune system
              for a strong day. These simple steps wake up your body without
              overwhelming your schedule. Over time, they add up to a more
              resilient immune response and calmer mind.

            <h2>Hydrate Within the First Ten Minutes</h2>
            <p>
              After hours of sleep, your body is mildly dehydrated. Drinking 300
              to 500 ml of room-temperature water with a squeeze of lemon
              replenishes fluids and supports lymphatic circulation, helping
              your body flush toxins and mobilize white blood cells.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Keep a reusable bottle on your nightstand for easy access, so
                you hydrate before checking your phone.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add electrolytes or a pinch of sea salt if you exercise early,
                sweat a lot, or take morning medications.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pair the water with a brief gratitude or breath awareness
                practice. Positive emotion reduces stress hormones that suppress
                immunity.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step Into Sunlight and Breathe</h2>
            <p>
              Sun exposure within an hour of waking resets your circadian
              rhythm, boosting daytime alertness and evening melatonin for
              sounder sleep. Just 2–10 minutes by an open window or outside
              stimulates natural vitamin D production—key for immune defense. A
              short breathing sequence (4-4-4: inhale, hold, exhale for 4 counts
              each) calms the nervous system so immune cells remain responsive,
              not reactive.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “Two minutes of outdoor light can shift your alertness for the
              rest of the day,” notes our resident sleep specialist, Dr. Ana
              Torres.
            </blockquote>
            <h2>Move Gently Before Breakfast</h2>
            <p>
              A five-minute stretch, mobility flow, or short walk increases
              circulation, wakes up digestion, and helps regulate inflammatory
              markers. The goal is to energize without exhausting: think
              shoulder rolls, neck mobility, hip circles, or even dancing to
              your favorite song.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sun Salutation or gentle yoga flow</li>
              <li>
                Dynamic stretches (arm swings, toe touches, walking lunges)
              </li>
              <li>5-minute neighborhood walk, ideally in the morning light</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>Action Step</h3>
              <p>
                Stack your habits: hydrate, open a window or step outside, and
                perform three rounds of box breathing while sunlight enters the
                room. By the time you reach breakfast, your body is already
                primed for nutrient absorption and calm focus.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Build a Balanced Breakfast</h3>
            <p>
              Combine protein, fiber, and healthy fats to stabilize blood sugar
              and provide the raw materials your immune cells need. Overnight
              oats with chia seeds, Greek yogurt, and berries is a five-minute
              option. Try a veggie omelet with olive oil and whole-grain toast,
              or a smoothie with leafy greens, nut butter, and hemp (or flax)
              seeds.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Key nutrients:</strong> Vitamin C (citrus, berries),
                zinc (pumpkin seeds), and probiotics (yogurt, kefir) all support
                immunity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Short on time?</strong> Pre-portion smoothie bags the
                night before or boil eggs for grab-and-go protein.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Habit Anchors for Lasting Results</h2>
            <p>
              The magic is in repetition, not perfection. Link your new habits
              to an existing anchor, like brushing your teeth or making coffee.
              Start with one morning upgrade at a time. Gradually, they’ll run
              on autopilot and support your immunity through every season.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Set a phone reminder for water or sunlight if you tend to
                forget.
              </li>
              <li>
                Involve the family: stretch or walk together—kids and adults
                benefit alike.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep breakfast ingredients simple and visible to make healthy
                choices effortless.
              </li>
