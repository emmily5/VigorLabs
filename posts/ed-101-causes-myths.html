              Erectile dysfunction (ED) is rarely about willpower. It is a
              circulation, hormone, and nerve story. Up to 40% of men in their
              40s experience ED, and the rate rises with age. The good news:
              most men see improvement by fixing the basics before relying on
              long-term medication.

            <h2>ED Is a Blood Flow Issue First</h2>
            <p>
              Erections depend on nitric oxide, healthy blood vessels, and
              pressure control. Anything that harms arteries—high blood
              pressure, smoking, diabetes, or chronic inflammation—hurts
              erections too. Think of ED as an early warning light for heart
              health, not just a bedroom concern.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Blood pressure:</strong> Target below 120/80 with your
                clinician; pressure damage stiffens vessels.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Blood sugar:</strong> Elevated glucose impairs nerves
                and nitric oxide production.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lifestyle hits:</strong> Tobacco, poor sleep, and heavy
                drinking choke circulation and testosterone.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Myths to Drop Immediately</h2>
            <p>
              ED is not always psychological, and it is not “just age.” Libido
              can be intact while erections lag because blood flow is
              compromised. Supplements alone will not fix structural or hormonal
              issues. Start with foundations and talk to a clinician before
              buying everything you see on social media.
            </p>
            <h2>First Two Weeks: Low-Risk, High-Return Habits</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Walk or cycle 25–30 minutes daily; interval-style cardio
                improves endothelial function.
              </li>
              <li>
                Eat protein-forward meals with olive oil, leafy greens, berries,
                and nuts to calm inflammation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cut nicotine; switch to nicotine replacement if needed and taper
                under guidance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sleep 7–9 hours; keep a fixed wake time to stabilize
                testosterone.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Talk With Your Clinician About Labs</h3>
            <p>
              Ask for fasting glucose, A1C, lipid panel, blood pressure, total
              testosterone (morning), and thyroid labs. If you are on
              medications for mood or blood pressure, ask whether any could
              affect erections and whether alternatives exist.
            </p>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>Action Plan for This Week</h3>
              <p>
                Walk daily, lift weights twice, add 3g of omega-3s from oily
                fish or supplements, and limit alcohol to two nights max. Track
                morning erections—they are a useful progress marker.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h2>When Medication Makes Sense</h2>
            <p>
              PDE5 inhibitors (like sildenafil) help blood reach the penis but
              do not repair artery health. They work best when paired with
              lifestyle changes. If ED appeared suddenly, especially with chest
              discomfort, seek medical care immediately—heart disease can hide
              behind ED.
            </p>
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              Fix the fundamentals before chasing quick fixes: movement,
              nutrition, sleep, and lab clarity. Most men notice better
              confidence and harder erections within weeks of consistent changes
              and proper clinical guidance.
