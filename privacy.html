      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="date-effective">Date Effective: July, 2025</p>

      <p>
        The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection
        practices of Arialief ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines the
        types of information that we gather about you while you are using the
        Arialief website (the "Site"), and the ways in which we use this
        information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy
        statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or
        that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at
        a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).
      </p>

      <p>
        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the
        Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy,
        is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving
        medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the
        future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on
        this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the
        date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any
        such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Collect and Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect and store personal or other information that you
        voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the
        Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). The
        Site only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or
        in the event that they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended
        one of our events, or have purchased one of our products. The Site
        collects personally identifying information from our users during online
        registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes
        name and e-mail address for registration or opt-in purposes and name,
        postal address, and credit card information when registering for our
        events or purchasing our products. All of this information is provided
        to us by you.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as
        you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect
        information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which
        allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages
        to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard
        feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your
        experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser
        places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how
        and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements,
        identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and
        patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences
        on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference
        information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel
        graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to
        count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site
        in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize
        features; advertising that appear on the Site; and, making other offers
        available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. 
      </p>
