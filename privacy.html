              The following Privacy Policy governs the online information
              collection practices of
              <span id="company-name">Virilis Science</span> ("we" or
              "us"). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we
              gather about you while you are using the
              <span id="company-name-2">Virilis Science</span> website
              (the "Site"), and the ways in which we use this information. This
              Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy statement, does
              not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may
              collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live
              event, via telephone, or through the mail).
            </p>

            <p>
              Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using
              the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute
              over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web
              is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at
              some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to
              this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date
              of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to
              use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the
              Privacy Policy as modified.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Collect and Use Information</h2>

            <p>
              We may collect and store personal or other information that you
              voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while
              on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on
              the Site). The Site only contacts individuals who specifically
              request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to
              receive our messaging, attended one of our events, or have
              purchased one of our products. The Site collects personally
              identifying information from our users during online registration
              and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name
              and e-mail address for registration or opt-in purposes and name,
              postal address, and credit card information when registering for
              our events or purchasing our products. All of this information is
              provided to us by you.
            </p>

            <p>
              We also collect and store information that is generated
              automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For
              example, we may collect information about your computer's
              connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things,
              to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure
              traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in
              browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with
              the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on
              your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and
              when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver
              advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track
              user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to
              re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you
              may have entered preference information before. The Site also may
              use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as
              "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit
              the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.
            </p>

            <p>
              We use the information we collect from you while you are using the
              Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to
              customize features; advertising that appear on the Site; and,
              making other offers available to you via email, direct mail or
              otherwise.
            </p>

              Site. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in
              order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing
              such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently
              received personally identifiable information from a user under the
              age of thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such
